Dev Roadmap
===========

The current version of geostates supports creating choropleth plots of the United States at the state level and state plots at the county level. In the future, the goal is to add: 

- Ability to plot United States maps at county-level granularities
- Add support for Congressional Districts, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and Zip Code Areas for individual state plots
- Add support for plotting categorical data for United States maps
- Add features for plotting political science maps (ie. Electoral College maps, etc.)
